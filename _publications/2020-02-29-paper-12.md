Abstract
=====
Radar satellites, such as Sentinel‐1, are now able to produce time series of ground deformation at any volcano around the world, but atmospheric effects still limit the real‐time detection of unrest at tropical volcanoes. Here, we test two approaches to correct atmospheric errors—phase elevation correlations and global weather models—and assess the ability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series to detect deformation anomalies using either a fixed threshold or a cumulative sum control chart. We use the 2017–2018 crisis at Agung volcano as a case example because strong atmospheric signals were originally mi
