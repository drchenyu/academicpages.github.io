Abstract
=====
For mapping Earth surface movements at larger scale and smaller amplitudes, many new synthetic aperture radar instruments (Sentinel‐1A/B, Gaofen‐3, ALOS‐2) have been developed and launched from 2014–2017, and this trend is set to continue with Sentinel‐1C/D, Gaofen‐3B/C, RADARSAT Constellation planned for launch during 2018–2025. This poses more challenges for correcting interferograms for atmospheric effects since the spatial‐temporal variations of tropospheric delay may dominate over large scales and completely mask the actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. To overcome this, we have developed a generic interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction model whose notable features comprise (i) global coverage, (ii) all‐weather, all‐time useability, (iii) correction maps available in near real time, and (iv) indicators to assess the correction performance and feasibility. The model integrates operational high‐resolution European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (0.125° grid, 137 vertical levels, and
