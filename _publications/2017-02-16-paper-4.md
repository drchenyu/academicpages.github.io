Abstract
=====
Pointwise GPS measurements of tropospheric zenith total delay can be interpolated to provide high‐resolution water vapor maps which may be used for correcting synthetic aperture radar images, for numeral weather prediction, and for correcting Network Real‐time Kinematic GPS observations. Several previous studies have addressed the importance of the elevation dependency of water vapor, but it is often a challenge to separate elevation‐dependent tropospheric delays from turbulent components. In this paper, we present an iterative tropospheric decomposition interpolation model that decouples the elevation and turbulent tropospheric delay components. For a 150?km?×?150?km California study region, we estimate real‐time mode zenith total delays at 41 GPS stations over 1?year by using the precise point positioning t
