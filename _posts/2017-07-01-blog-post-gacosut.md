======
./applygacos.py inpfilename ztd1filename ztd2filename elevfilename  
   inpfilenmae : input interferogram, a inpfilename.rsc is needed!  
   ztd1filename: input GACOS ztd day1 filename, a ztd1filename.rsc is needed!  
   ztd2filename: input GACOS ztd day2 filename, a ztd2filename.rsc is needed!  
   elevfilename: elevation angle file, must be the same size with interferogram  
                 elevation=90-incidence  
                 can be generated by look_vector in gamma  
outputfile will be saved as inpfilename.gacos  
!!Note, python3 is needed!!
