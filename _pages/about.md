I am a professor at the College of Geological Engineering and Geomatics, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China. I major in the research of monitoring and interpreting geo-hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and ground subsidence using a variety of Earth Observations (EO). My main objective is to develop a geo-hazard Early Warning System (EWS) with the capacity of early-stage hazard detection and pre-warning, risk assessment of the hazard affected area and rapid responding to catastrophic events.
